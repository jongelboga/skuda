    <h1>This is the second section</h1>
<p>A massive, fizzing, dense coffee-colored head rises from the pour and settles to a foam lace. Deep, rich, nearly opaque black, with ruby hues around the edges. Soft but distinct fresh coffee grounds in the nose, along with chocolate and roasted notes. Smooth, firm and even in the mouth, and not too heavy. Quite acrid up front, with a mouthful of roasted astringency, char, a sharp and semi-sour bite and a weakish watery hop flavor of the rind-like citrus variety just beneath the sourness. Minimal sweetness provides little balance, and allows the dryness of the beer to dominate. Smoky undertones. Bone-dry finish with residual roasted, stale-ish coffee grounds and acrid flavors lingering, not overly pleasant, too tannic-like.</p>
